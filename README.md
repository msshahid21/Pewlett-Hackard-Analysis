# Pewlett Hackard Analysis
## Overview
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to inform the manager at Pewlett Hackard about the growing age of their workforce and to prepare them for the vacancies that will have to be filled as a result of the older workforce retiring soon. Furthermore, management also requested for a list of retiring employees that could help with mentoring incoming employees.

## Results
### Number of Employees Close to Retiring
The total number of employees in PH are 300,024 employees, out of which 72,458 are close to the retiring age. This is about 24% of the workforce that will have to be replaced.

### Retiring Titles
The Titles that have the most retiring employees are Senior Engineers and Senior Staff, which collectively accounts for 70% of all the retiring titles.

### Seniority of Retirees
From the above table it can be seen that most of the retiring employees are also high ranking, and are in leadership positions, with only 7,636 of the retiring employees employed as staff members.

### Mentors Available
There are 1,549 potential mentors, employees that are close to to the retirement age, that will be able to help train the incoming employees to fill in the shortfall of employees in the workforce due to the silver tsunami.

## Summary
The two questions asked by management were:
- Determine the number of retiring employees per title
- Identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program

From the above results we can see that management will have to fill a gap of 72,458 jobs (24% of the total workforce) with a majority of the retiring employees being Senior Engineer and Senior Staff, thus these are leadership / management positions that need to be filled, and will require more experienced employees to take up those positions. However, there are only 1,549 employees available to train the employees required to fill 72,458 jobs. This currently means that 1 mentor would have to potentially train ~47 employees on average.

### Additional Tables
#### Mentorship Spread
The following table shows the spread of the mentors expertise:

As can be seen from the above, most of the mentors have the Staff and Senior Engineer Title, while many Senior Engineers will be required to train future employees, there is more of a need for Senior Staff employees rather than Staff employees for mentoring. Therefore, the two problems arise with the current range of mentors, there are not enough mentors, and the spread of the mentors experience is not similar to the spread of the titles of the retiring employees.

#### Retirees by Department
The following table shows the retirees per department:

As can be seen from above the Development, Production, and Sales departments will require most of the hiring (63% of vacancies). This will give management an additional insight on the most common skills that will be required by the new hires.
